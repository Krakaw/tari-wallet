### Notes

- Tests should be placed in the same file as the code files they are testing following Rust conventions.
- Use `cargo test` to run all tests, or `cargo test test_name` to run specific tests.
- Use `cargo test --features grpc-storage` for most comprehensive test coverage.
- The refactoring must maintain 100% backward compatibility for CLI interfaces.

## General
- Before claiming a task is complete make sure to run the following:
   - wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir examples/wasm/pkg --features http
   - cargo run --bin scanner --features grpc-storage -- --from-block=16000 --to-block=16020
   - cargo run --bin wallet --features grpc-storage 
   - cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
- **IMPORTANT** The goal of these tasks is to make the binaries slim wrappers around the libs.
- At the end of each task generate a meaningful commit message including the task number.
